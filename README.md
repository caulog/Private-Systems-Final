## Overview

We investigated the [NYC Tuition Assitance Program data](https://data.ny.gov/Education/Tuition-Assistance-Program-TAP-Recipients-Dollars-/2t78-bs45/about_data) looking for quasi-identifiers that could lead to potential privacy leaks.

As part of our study, we developed a Python CLI tool, `find-quasi-ids`. We hope this tool is useful in conducting other privacy-preserving data analysis.
